  <h3>Friedrich and Maria Baumann</h3>

  <p>
    <strong>Emilie Georgina Baumann</strong> was the only daughter of <strong>Friedrich Baumann</strong> and
    <strong>Maria Dosch Baumann</strong>, a hardworking family whose story intertwined with the industrial and social life of
    early 20th-century Germany.
  </p>
    
  <p>
    <strong>Andreas Michael Friedrich Baumann</strong> was born on <strong>December 21, 1868</strong>, in
    <strong>Crailsheim, Baden, Germany</strong>. Known throughout his life as <em>Friedrich</em>, he was confirmed in
    <strong>1882</strong> in Crailsheim as a member of the Protestant Church. His professional life reflected Germany’s
    industrial age—he worked as a <strong>locomotive engineer</strong>, <strong>ironworker</strong>, and later as a
    <strong>foreman</strong> with <strong>BASF</strong> in <strong>Ludwigshafen</strong>. Friedrich died on
    <strong>August 9, 1943</strong>, in Ludwigshafen and was buried on <strong>August 12, 1943</strong>, in
    <strong>Oppau, Pfalz, Germany</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Friedrich married <strong>Maria Dosch</strong>, daughter of <strong>Georg Gottlieb Dosch</strong> and
    <strong>Maria Magdalena Gohring</strong>, on <strong>July 31, 1892</strong>, in <strong>Blaufelden, Germany</strong>.
    Maria was born on <strong>May 18, 1869</strong>, in <strong>Brettenfeld, Baden, Germany</strong>, and confirmed in
    <strong>1883</strong> in <strong>Rot am See</strong>. She worked as a <strong>dressmaker</strong>. Maria died on
    <strong>September 18, 1954</strong>, in <strong>Oppau</strong> at the age of <strong>85</strong>, and was buried there on
    <strong>September 20, 1954</strong>.
