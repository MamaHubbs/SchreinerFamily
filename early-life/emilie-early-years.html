    <h2>Emilieâ€™s Early Years (1.2)</h2>
    <p><strong>Emilie Georgina Baumann</strong> was born on 23 Apr 1911 in Oppau, Pfalz, Germany. She was the only daughter of Friedrich Baumann and Maria Dosch Baumann. Emilie's father, Friedrich, was employed as a locomotive engineer, ironworker, and foreman with the BASF in Ludwigshafen. Fortunately, he had not yet reported to work when the 1921 explosion occurred.</p>
    <p>Emilie's brother, Karl Baumann, was killed as a captain in the German army during WWI. Emilie's siblings included Fritz, August, Karl, and Wilhem (Willie). Emilie had a summer home in Beimbach, near Rot am See in Wurttemberg, Germany, where she spent many summers.</p>
