    <h2>Adam’s Early Years (1.1)</h2>
    <p><strong>Adam Schreiner</strong> was born 1 Dec 1905 in Oppau, Pfalz, Germany. He was the son of Martin Schreiner (born 1870) and Eva Reich Schreiner (born 1872). Adam was closest to his next younger brother, Peter. Adam went to school through the equivalent of the 8th grade, then went on to trade school, apprenticing as a stonemason in 1923.</p>
    <p>Adam’s father, Martin, a foreman at BASF, was killed in the **1921 BASF explosion** in Ludwigshafen. His body was never found. The explosion killed several hundred people and damaged many houses in Oppau.</p>
