    <h2>Adam’s Early Years</h2>
   <section id="family-roots">
    <h2>The Schreiner Family Roots</h2>
    <p>
      Adam Schreiner was the son of <strong>Martin Schreiner</strong> and
      <strong>Eva Reich Schreiner</strong>, both lifelong residents of the Pfalz
      region in Germany. His father, Martin, was born on <strong>May 7, 1870</strong>,
      in <strong>Heiligenstein, Pfalz, Bayern</strong>, where he was also christened the same day.
      Martin later moved to <strong>Ludwigshafen</strong>, where he worked as a
      <em>Meister</em> (major foreman) at the BASF chemical plant. Tragically, he was killed in the
      <strong>1921 BASF explosion</strong>, one of the worst industrial disasters in German history.
      His body was never found, and he was buried in <strong>Oppau, Pfalz, Germany</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin married <strong>Eva Reich</strong> on <strong>February 17, 1894</strong>, in Oppau.
      Eva was born on <strong>January 1, 1872</strong>, also in Oppau, the daughter of
      <strong>Michael Reich</strong> and <strong>Barbara Babette Beringer</strong>. She lived a long
      life, passing away on <strong>September 3, 1964</strong>, at the age of 92.
    </p>

  <section id="early-family-life">
    <h2>Early Family Life</h2>
    <p>
      It is not known when Martin left the Schreiner family’s historical home area of
      <strong>Harthausen and Heiligenstein</strong> for Oppau, but it was likely as a young man
      seeking work. Eva, being a native of Oppau, probably met Martin there. Their first child,
      <strong>Martin Jr.</strong>, was born out of wedlock, and Eva was already pregnant with their
      second child, <strong>Jakob</strong>, when they married in a civil ceremony. The marriage
      record confirms Martin as the father of both children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Interestingly, the couple remarried in the <strong>Catholic Church in Oppau</strong> on
      <strong>November 5, 1911</strong>—many years after their civil union. Though the reason is
      unknown, it’s likely they were “legitimizing” their marriage so their children could marry
      within the Church.
    </p>

  <section id="children">
    <h2>The Children of Martin and Eva Schreiner</h2>
    <p>
      Together, Martin and Eva had <strong>twelve children</strong>, whose lives reflected both the
      hardships and resilience of early 20th-century Germany.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Martin Schreiner (1890–1969)</strong> married Elizabeth (Betche) Mörschel and had four children.
        A WWI veteran, he deserted the army after losing his brother Michael and eventually settled in
        Hinterweidenthal, where he lived the rest of his life.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Jacob Schreiner (1894–1970)</strong> married Charlotte (Lotte) Steinmüller and had three daughters.
        As a child, Jacob lost an eye in a tragic accident involving his sister Anna.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Michael Schreiner (1896–1918)</strong> died while serving in WWI. His death deeply affected his brother Martin.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Joseph “Sepple” Schreiner (1897–1917)</strong> also died as a soldier during WWI and is buried in the
        <em>Kriegsgräberstätte</em> (Soldiers’ Cemetery) in Oppau.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Anna Schreiner (1900–1979)</strong> married Johann Franger and had nine children. Known for her warmth and humor,
        she was widowed early and visited family in America several times.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Benedict (Benno) Schreiner (1902–1970)</strong> owned a popular restaurant and bowling alley in Oppau,
        which became a favorite family gathering place.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Susanna Schreiner (1904–1906)</strong> died in early childhood; little is known about her life.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Adam Schreiner (1905–1987)</strong>—the subject of this story—was born in Oppau and later immigrated to the United States.
        He married <strong>Emilie Georgina Baumann</strong> in 1929, and they had three children. Adam became a U.S. citizen in 1944.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Peter Schreiner (1907–1974)</strong> married Anna Kohler and had seven children. He worked at BASF for over forty years
        and was known for his humor and closeness with Adam.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Luitpold Schreiner (1909–1991)</strong> married Lisa Scheuermann and had one son, Hans.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Paula Schreiner (1911–1999)</strong> married Erwin Fries and cared for their mother Eva until her death. Their home at
        <strong>32 Dammbruch Strasse</strong> in Oppau was a cherished family meeting place.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Theobald “Dewald” Schreiner (1913–1959)</strong> married Martha Stubenrauch and worked his way into management at BASF.
        Despite his success, he died young from complications of diabetes.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <section id="family-home">
    <h2>The Family Home in Oppau</h2>
    <p>
      The Schreiner family home at <strong>32 Dammbruch Strasse</strong> held deep roots in family history.
      Adam was born there in <strong>1905</strong>, indicating the family had lived in the home by the early 20th century.
      The original structure was likely a two-story house with a basement. Sadly, it was
      <strong>destroyed during World War II</strong> and later rebuilt as a three-story building.
    </p>
    <p>
      The postwar home became a lively gathering place for the extended Schreiner family. The backyard, garage, and narrow
      alleyway behind the house are fondly remembered as central to many family celebrations.
      Photographs from <strong>1968</strong> capture this sense of togetherness.

  <section id="adam-early-years">
    <h2>Childhood and Early Years of Adam Schreiner</h2>
    <p>
      Little is known about Adam’s early childhood, but family stories paint a picture of an
      <strong>active and mischievous</strong> boy. He was particularly close to his younger brother Peter, and the two were often
      inseparable. At family dinners, Adam recalled, the children had to be quick if they wanted enough to eat—
      mealtimes were lively and competitive in a household of twelve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite the large family, they seemed to live comfortably enough. Martin, Adam’s father, was a respected foreman at BASF,
      and his work provided stability until his untimely death in 1921. The <strong>Oppau explosion</strong> that claimed his life
      devastated the community, killing thousands and prompting relief efforts from around the world. The Schreiner home likely
      sustained some damage, though the extent is unknown.
    </p>

  <section id="education-apprenticeship">
    <h2>Education and Apprenticeship</h2>
    <p>
      Adam’s schooling likely continued through the equivalent of <strong>eighth grade</strong>, after which he attended
      <strong>trade school</strong>. By <strong>1923</strong>, he was working as a <strong>stonemason apprentice</strong>,
      as seen in a family photograph from that time. These early years shaped the discipline, work ethic, and resilience that
      would later define his life as an immigrant and family man.
