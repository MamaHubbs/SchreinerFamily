    <h3>Martin and Eva</h3>
    <p>
      Adam Schreiner was the son of <strong>Martin Schreiner</strong> and <strong>Eva Reich Schreiner</strong>, both lifelong residents of the Pfalz region of Germany.
      The Schreiner family’s history is rooted in the villages of <strong>Heiligenstein</strong> and <strong>Harthausen</strong>, while the Reich family hailed from <strong>Oppau</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Martin Schreiner</strong> was born on <strong>May 7, 1870</strong>, in <strong>Heiligenstein, Pfalz, Bayern, Germany</strong>, and was christened there the same day.
      He later moved to <strong>Ludwigshafen</strong>, where he worked for the BASF chemical company as a <em>Meister</em> (major foreman). On <strong>September 21, 1921</strong>, Martin was killed in the
      <strong>BASF explosion</strong> in Ludwigshafen, one of the deadliest industrial disasters of its time. His body was never recovered, and he was buried in <strong>Oppau, Pfalz, Germany</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Eva Reich</strong>, daughter of <strong>Michael Reich</strong> and <strong>Barbara Babette Beringer</strong>, was born on <strong>January 1, 1872</strong>, in <strong>Oppau</strong>.
      She married Martin on <strong>February 17, 1894</strong>, in a civil ceremony in Oppau. Eva lived a long life, passing away on <strong>September 3, 1964</strong>, in Oppau at the age of 92.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little is known about how Martin and Eva met. Martin likely left the Schreiner family’s traditional home area in Heiligenstein as a teenager seeking work in Oppau, where Eva lived.
      Their relationship began unconventionally for the time: their first child, <strong>Martin Jr.</strong>, was born out of wedlock, and Eva was pregnant with their second child, <strong>Jakob</strong>, when they married.
      The civil marriage record identifies Martin as the father of both children and lists two witnesses from Oppau. Many years later, on <strong>November 5, 1911</strong>, Martin and Eva were remarried in the
      <strong>Catholic Church in Oppau</strong>, likely to “legitimize” their union so that their children could marry within the Church.

            hid in Hinterweidenthal, and later settled there permanently. Roger recalls him as “a very gentle man.”

    <h3>Life in Oppau and the BASF Explosion</h3>
    <p>
      Roger describes the family’s early life as close-knit and energetic. Adam and his brother Peter were especially inseparable.
      Mealtimes in a large household were competitive—“you had to be quick if you wanted enough to eat”—yet despite the size of the family, they seemed to live comfortably enough.

    <p>
      As a BASF foreman, Martin provided stability. During the workweek, when he returned home, the children left the dining room so <strong>Eva</strong> could serve him dinner in quiet; noise during the meal meant trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <strong>1921</strong>, the <strong>BASF chemical explosion in Ludwigshafen</strong> claimed Martin’s life along with thousands of workers and nearby residents. The disaster drew <strong>worldwide attention</strong>,
      and <strong>Red Cross donations from around the world</strong> poured into the region to aid survivors. Roger notes this relief would later prove significant for the family,
      ultimately contributing to his grandparents’ path to <strong>America</strong>. Many houses in Oppau were severely damaged; the extent of damage to the Schreiner home is unknown.

    <h3>The Family Home at 32 Dammbruch Strasse</h3>
    <p>
      The Schreiner home at <strong>32 Dammbruch Strasse</strong> in Oppau symbolizes the family’s endurance. Adam was born there in <strong>1905</strong>,
      indicating the family had established the home by the early 20th century. The original house was likely a two-story structure with a full basement.
      It was destroyed during <strong>World War II</strong> and later rebuilt as a three-story home. At one point, the ground floor was rented out.
      A small garage stood behind the house, reached by a narrow alley—so tight that “nothing larger than a VW Beetle could fit through.”
    </p>

      A photograph from <strong>1968</strong> shows family members gathered in the backyard of the rebuilt home. The leftmost portion represents the Schreiner section of the property.
      Roger believes the original prewar home was two stories, while the postwar version was expanded. The home remained a gathering place for decades.

<section id="education">
  <h3>Adam’s Education and Apprenticeship</h3>
  <p>
    Little is known about Adam’s early education, but it is believed that he attended school through the equivalent of
    <strong>eighth grade</strong> before enrolling in <strong>trade school</strong>. By <strong>1923</strong>, he was training
    as a <strong>stonemason apprentice</strong>, a discipline that reflected his work ethic and would serve him well in later life.
  </p>
  <p>
    Roger notes that a photograph from that year shows Adam in his apprentice uniform, marking the start of his adult life.

      “They built all the old churches and buildings. No cement was used; all the stones were carefully placed, and these
      buildings stand after hundreds of years. He brought some of his masonry books to the USA, and they were heavy into
      algebra and trigonometry.” — <em>Egon Schreiner</em>
