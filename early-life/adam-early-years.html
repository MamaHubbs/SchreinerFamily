    <h3>Martin and Eva</h3>
    <p>
      Adam Schreiner was the son of <strong>Martin Schreiner</strong> and <strong>Eva Reich Schreiner</strong>, both lifelong residents of the Pfalz region of Germany.
      The Schreiner family’s history is rooted in the villages of <strong>Heiligenstein</strong> and <strong>Harthausen</strong>, while the Reich family hailed from <strong>Oppau</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Martin Schreiner</strong> was born on <strong>May 7, 1870</strong>, in <strong>Heiligenstein, Pfalz, Bayern, Germany</strong>, and was christened there the same day.
      He later moved to <strong>Ludwigshafen</strong>, where he worked for the BASF chemical company as a <em>Meister</em> (major foreman). On <strong>September 21, 1921</strong>, Martin was killed in the
      <strong>BASF explosion</strong> in Ludwigshafen, one of the deadliest industrial disasters of its time. His body was never recovered, and he was buried in <strong>Oppau, Pfalz, Germany</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Eva Reich</strong>, daughter of <strong>Michael Reich</strong> and <strong>Barbara Babette Beringer</strong>, was born on <strong>January 1, 1872</strong>, in <strong>Oppau</strong>.
      She married Martin on <strong>February 17, 1894</strong>, in a civil ceremony in Oppau. Eva lived a long life, passing away on <strong>September 3, 1964</strong>, in Oppau at the age of 92.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little is known about how Martin and Eva met. Martin likely left the Schreiner family’s traditional home area in Heiligenstein as a teenager seeking work in Oppau, where Eva lived.
      Their relationship began unconventionally for the time: their first child, <strong>Martin Jr.</strong>, was born out of wedlock, and Eva was pregnant with their second child, <strong>Jakob</strong>, when they married.
      The civil marriage record identifies Martin as the father of both children and lists two witnesses from Oppau. Many years later, on <strong>November 5, 1911</strong>, Martin and Eva were remarried in the
      <strong>Catholic Church in Oppau</strong>, likely to “legitimize” their union so that their children could marry within the Church.

    <h3>The Children of Martin and Eva</h3>
    <p>Martin and Eva had <strong>twelve children</strong>, whose lives reflected both the hardships and resilience of early 20th-century Germany.</p>
    <ul>
      <li id="child-martin">
        <strong>Martin Schreiner</strong> (born <strong>December 18, 1890</strong>, Oppau; died <strong>March 29, 1969</strong>, Hinterweidenthal) married <strong>Elizabeth (Betche) Mörschel</strong> on <strong>December 7, 1913</strong> and had four children.
        He served in World War I. After learning that his brother <strong>Michael</strong> had been killed in the war, he deserted—likely near the end of the conflict—hid in the Hinterweidenthal area, and later settled there permanently.
        Roger recalls him as “a very gentle man.”
      </li>
      <li id="child-jacob">
        <strong>Jacob Schreiner</strong> (born <strong>March 27, 1894</strong>, Oppau; died <strong>March 24, 1970</strong>, Oppau) married <strong>Charlotte (Lotte) Steinmüller</strong> on <strong>September 7, 1917</strong> and had three daughters.
        He lost an eye in childhood. Roger recounts Tanta Anna’s story from Lake Hill: the children were playing, some at the table and some underneath; Jacob asked for scissors to be passed down,
        and Anna accidentally handed them point-first, causing the injury. Roger remembers Jacob’s stern, intimidating presence.
      </li>
      <li id="child-michael">
        <strong>Michael Schreiner</strong> (born <strong>1896</strong>; died <strong>1918</strong>) served in the German army during World War I and was killed in action. The details of his death are unknown. His loss prompted his brother Martin to desert.
      </li>
      <li id="child-joseph">
        <strong>Joseph “Sepple” Schreiner</strong> (born <strong>November 26, 1897</strong>, Oppau; died <strong>April 27, 1917</strong>) also served in the German army during World War I and is buried in the <strong>Kriegsgräberstätte</strong> (soldiers’ cemetery) in Oppau.
        The circumstances of his death are unknown. A photograph shows Sepple in a German army hospital around <strong>1918</strong>, looking unwell.
      </li>
      <li id="child-anna">
        <strong>Anna Schreiner</strong> (born <strong>January 9, 1900</strong>; died <strong>April 20, 1979</strong>) married <strong>Johann Franger</strong> and had nine children.
        Known for warmth and humor, she lost her husband early and never remarried. Roger recalls her visiting his parents in America several times.
      </li>
      <li id="child-benedict">
        <strong>Benedict (Benno) Schreiner</strong> (born <strong>March 1, 1902</strong>; died <strong>July 1, 1970</strong>, Oppau) married <strong>Erna Margarete (Greta) Dornick</strong> on <strong>December 26, 1926</strong> and had three children.
        Benno owned a restaurant and bar in Oppau that became a family hub, with a back room for parties and a small bowling alley. Roger recalls, “It was a great place to hang out.”
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Susanna Schreiner</strong> (born <strong>1904</strong>; died <strong>1906</strong>) died in early childhood. No records of her exact birth or death dates, cause of death, or burial place have been found.
      </li>
      <li id="child-adam">
        <strong>Adam Schreiner</strong> (born <strong>December 1, 1905</strong>, Oppau; died <strong>March 25, 1987</strong>, St. Petersburg, Florida) married <strong>Emilie Georgina Baumann</strong> on <strong>May 18, 1929</strong>, in Oppau, and they had three children.
        He later immigrated to the United States and became a naturalized citizen on <strong>November 16, 1944</strong>, in <strong>Brooklyn, New York</strong>. His godfather was also named <strong>Adam Schreiner</strong>, his father’s uncle.
      </li>
      <li id="child-peter">
        <strong>Peter Schreiner</strong> (born <strong>November 11, 1907</strong>; died <strong>July 27, 1974</strong>, Edigheim) married <strong>Anna Kohler</strong> on <strong>December 20, 1928</strong> and had seven children.
        He worked for BASF for over forty years. Roger recalls Peter’s humor and energy, his visits to America, and the lively entertainment he and his son <strong>Theo</strong> brought to family gatherings.
      </li>
      <li id="child-luitpold">
        <strong>Luitpold Schreiner</strong> (born <strong>August 13, 1909</strong>, Oppau; died <strong>July 31, 1991</strong>, Edigheim) married <strong>Lisa Scheuermann</strong> on <strong>September 3, 1930</strong> and had one son, <strong>Hans</strong>.
      </li>
      <li id="child-paula">
        <strong>Paula Schreiner</strong> (born <strong>August 10, 1911</strong>, Oppau; died <strong>November 16, 1999</strong>, Oppau) married <strong>Erwin Fries</strong> on <strong>May 14, 1932</strong>.
        She cared for her mother, Eva, for the remainder of Eva’s life. The family home at <strong>32 Dammbruch Strasse</strong>, where Adam was born, remained a cherished gathering place;
        Roger fondly remembers several get-togethers there.
      </li>
      <li id="child-theobald">
        <strong>Theobald “Dewald” Schreiner</strong> (born <strong>June 24, 1913</strong>; died <strong>July 20, 1959</strong>, Oppau) married <strong>Martha Stubenrauch</strong>.
        The youngest of the twelve, he was often teased by his siblings. He rose into management at BASF and was known for generosity and humor.
        He developed diabetes—likely worsened by drinking and smoking—and, declining to change his habits, died young at 46.

    <h3>Life in Oppau and the BASF Explosion</h3>
    <p>
      Roger describes the family’s early life as close-knit and energetic. Adam and his brother Peter were especially inseparable.
      Mealtimes in a large household were competitive—“you had to be quick if you wanted enough to eat”—yet despite the size of the family, they seemed to live comfortably enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a BASF foreman, Martin provided stability. During the workweek, when he returned home, the children left the dining room so <strong>Eva</strong> could serve him dinner in quiet; noise during the meal meant trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <strong>1921</strong>, the <strong>BASF chemical explosion in Ludwigshafen</strong> claimed Martin’s life along with thousands of workers and nearby residents. The disaster drew <strong>worldwide attention</strong>,
      and <strong>Red Cross donations from around the world</strong> poured into the region to aid survivors. Roger notes this relief would later prove significant for the family,
      ultimately contributing to his grandparents’ path to <strong>America</strong>. Many houses in Oppau were severely damaged; the extent of damage to the Schreiner home is unknown.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="family-home">
    <h3>The Family Home at 32 Dammbruch Strasse</h3>
    <p>
      The Schreiner home at <strong>32 Dammbruch Strasse</strong> in Oppau symbolizes the family’s endurance. Adam was born there in <strong>1905</strong>,
      indicating the family had established the home by the early 20th century. The original house was likely a two-story structure with a full basement.
      It was destroyed during <strong>World War II</strong> and later rebuilt as a three-story home. At one point, the ground floor was rented out.
      A small garage stood behind the house, reached by a narrow alley—so tight that “nothing larger than a VW Beetle could fit through.”
    </p>

    <p>
      A photograph from <strong>1968</strong> shows family members gathered in the backyard of the rebuilt home. The leftmost portion represents the Schreiner section of the property.
      Roger believes the original prewar home was two stories, while the postwar version was expanded. The home remained a gathering place for decades.

  <section id="education">
    <h3>Adam’s Education and Apprenticeship</h3>
    <p>
      Little is known about Adam’s early education. He likely attended school through the equivalent of <strong>eighth grade</strong> and then entered <strong>trade school</strong>.
      By <strong>1923</strong>, he was training as a <strong>stonemason apprentice</strong>—a discipline that reflected his work ethic and would serve him well in later life.
      A photograph from that year shows Adam in his apprentice uniform, marking the start of his adult life.
