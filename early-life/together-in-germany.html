    <h2>Together in Germany (1.3)</h2>
    <p>Adam and Emilie are believed to have first met in 1926. They married on **May 18, 1929**, at the Protestant Church in Oppau. This marriage was complicated by their religious differences (Adam was Catholic, Emilie was Protestant).</p>
    <p>They emigrated due to the difficulty of their "mixed" marriage, the political climate (rumors Pop was unpopular with the Nazi movement), and limited employment opportunities.</p>
