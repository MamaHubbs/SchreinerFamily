  <h3>How They Met</h3>
  <p>
    The exact story of how <strong>Emilie</strong> and <strong>Adam</strong> first met is uncertain. Roger believes their paths
    crossed around <strong>1926</strong>, and the impression is that they did not know each other well before becoming involved.
    Their ages—<strong>15</strong> for Emilie and <strong>21</strong> for Adam—help explain that distance. Religious background also posed a challenge:
    Emilie came from a <strong>Protestant</strong> family, while Adam was <strong>Catholic</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Their relationship led to a pregnancy. During this time, Emilie was sent to <strong>Goldbach</strong> to live with an
    <strong>Utz</strong> family. As the birth approached, she went to a birthing home in <strong>Heidelberg</strong>, where
    <strong>Egon</strong> was born on <strong>August 31, 1927</strong>.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “What I remember is that Mom’s mother sent her away; Mom’s father did not know of any pregnancy—had he known, he would
      have been very, very upset. I believe he didn’t see Mom again until I was born. As I grew up, he completely melted.
      I even remember sleeping in his bed. He always kept chocolate in his night table for me and for my Großmutter.
      Inwardly he was a very soft person, but outwardly he put on a tough-guy act.” — <em>Egon Schreiner</em>
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    At some point, Adam and Emilie decided to marry. They first sought a ceremony in the <strong>Catholic Church</strong>, but
    the priest refused to marry them because Emilie was Protestant.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “They could have been married in the Catholic Church, but not at the main altar. Pop would not accept being married in a
      side room. He had served as an altar boy at that church.” — <em>Egon Schreiner</em>
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Eventually, arrangements were made for a wedding in the <strong>Protestant Church in Oppau</strong>. (As an aside, after
    <strong>World War II</strong>, Emilie collected donations in <strong>Ridgewood</strong> to help fund a replacement
    <strong>stained glass window</strong> for that church, which had been destroyed during the war.) Emilie and Adam were married on
    <strong>May 18, 1929</strong>, at the Protestant Church in Oppau. Independent in spirit, Emilie chose a <strong>white wedding gown</strong>—a
    departure from the local tradition of <strong>black</strong> wedding dresses.

  <p>
    It is not clear how fully each family was represented at the service, but they did have both a <strong>church wedding</strong>
    and a <strong>civil ceremony</strong>. A post-wedding celebration photograph (location unknown) shows strong representation from both families.

  <p>
    After the wedding, the couple lived <strong>upstairs on Friedrichstr.</strong> in Emilie’s parents’ house. <strong>Erika</strong> remembered
    that the home was arranged as a <strong>two-family</strong> residence, with Emilie and Adam having their <strong>own kitchen</strong>.
    She spent much time there.
