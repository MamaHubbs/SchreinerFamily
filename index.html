        <h2>The Story of Adam Schreiner (1905-1987) and Emilie Georgine Baumann Schreiner (1911-2003)</h2>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>This narrative captures selected events in the lives of Emilie and Adam, as interpreted by their son, Roger Schreiner, with help from many family members. This serves as a living history, meant to be expanded as new information becomes available. The goal is to provide information about the Schreiner and Baumann family history for younger descendants and to spur general interest in the family's traditions.</p>
        
        <h3>Dedication</h3>
        <p>This story is dedicated to Adam and Emilie Georgine Baumann Schreiner, who provided their sons with a wonderful childhood experience, a sense of family, and strong values. It is difficult to imagine a more wonderful and exciting childhood than the one provided by these two parents who lived a lifetime and more together.</p>

        <h3>Note on Sources</h3>
        <p>References to Mom, Pop, Oma’s, and Opa’s are relative to Adam and Emilie, meaning they are the speaker's Mom and Pop, and their parents are the speaker's Oma’s and Opa’s (in general).</p>
