  <h3>Making the Decision</h3>
  <p>
    The decision for <strong>Adam</strong> and <strong>Emilie</strong> to emigrate from Germany grew out of several pressures.
    Their <strong>“mixed” marriage</strong>—Emilie from a <strong>Protestant</strong> family and Adam from a <strong>Catholic</strong> one—had created strain.
    Added to that were unsettled employment prospects in the late 1920s and the rise of the <strong>Nazi movement</strong>.
    Roger notes there were <strong>rumors</strong> that Adam was <strong>not in favor with the Nazis</strong> and may have had <strong>Communist affiliations</strong>,
    which, whether true or not, would have further complicated life in Germany.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “It took a great deal of courage to leave your birthplace and come to America. Not knowing anyone except the Ottos through
      the mail, not knowing the language, no idea as to the future. It must have been very difficult to leave behind their
      two-year-old—but as we all know, it was a terrific decision. Without their coming here, the entire family would have
      grown up in Germany and lived through the hardships of World War II.” — <em>Egon Schreiner</em>
    </p>
  </blockquote>

    The path to America began with an act of charity after the <strong>1921 BASF explosion</strong> in Ludwigshafen. Through the
    <strong>Red Cross</strong>, Emilie or her mother received a <strong>donated fur coat</strong> from a family in the United States.
    In its pocket was a <strong>piece of paper</strong> with the donors’ <strong>name and address</strong>. Emilie saved that slip and later wrote to ask
    whether they would <strong>sponsor</strong> her and Adam to immigrate.

  <p>
    The correspondence timeline is unknown, but the donors—<strong>Mr. and Mrs. Paul Otto</strong> of <strong>Brooklyn</strong> (later on
    <strong>Long Island</strong>)—agreed to sponsor them. With arrangements made, <strong>Adam and Emilie sailed from Hamburg on June 20, 1930</strong>,
    and <strong>arrived in New York City on June 28, 1930</strong>. Because they were <strong>sponsored and met at the regular pier</strong>, they
    <strong>did not disembark at Ellis Island</strong> and did not go through the usual immigration processing there.

  <p>
    Given the uncertainties of starting over—new country, <strong>no job yet</strong>, and no clear prospects—<strong>Egon</strong> (then
    <strong>two years old</strong>) stayed behind in <strong>Oppau</strong> with <strong>Emilie’s parents</strong> until Adam and Emilie could establish themselves.
    Emilie later referred to a photograph with their sponsors, the <strong>Otto</strong> family, as her <strong>first picture in America</strong>.
